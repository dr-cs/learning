# Python Data Analytics

This project contains notes and practice code with the Python data analytics stack, sometimes known as "SciPy."

To get started on your local machine:

```shell
# In the python-data directory
 python3 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate
 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using PyCharm, configure your PyCharm project to use the interpreter in the `venv` directory.  Be sure to select "Existing" interpreter (since you already created it from the terminal using the commands above). See [PyCharm's docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html).
